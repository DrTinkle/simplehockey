# SimpleHockey
A very simple hockey game.

This is a very simple hockey game idea and my first independent project.

It is a one-player game against an AI or a two-player game with one player using `WASD` and the other using arrow keys.

## Currently Implemented
- Scoreboard
- Simple physics-based movement
- Speed and rotation multiplier for player in lead
- Player reset
- Simple AI
- "Fun" shoot mechanic

## Future Development
- SFX & music
- Updated sprites
- VFX
